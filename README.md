# number base converter
Finally, a repository that does something barely count as useful.
I got 2 versions of code here, one's maximum base number is 36 and output string while another's maximum base number is 10 and output float, 
use them depending on your purpose
More informations is on the codes' comments
# Note: max base 36 method is NOT finished as some unexpected error results while I still cant find a way to solve it.
