# number base converter
Finally, a repository that does something barely count as useful.
I got 2 versions of code here, one's maximum base number is 36 and output string while another's maximum base number is 10 and output float, 
use them depending on your purpose
More informations is on the codes' comments
# Note: max base 36 method is NOT finished as some unexpected error results while I still cant find a way to solve it.
You will need to change the code in main.py if you changed the name of Base10.py or/and Base36.py, and you will need all 3 of them if you are planning to use main.py. 
If you find a way to make Base36.py works as it intended, feel free to make a pull request and change it, I will thank you alot.
