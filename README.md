# number base converter
Finally, a repository that does something barely count as useful.
I got 2 versions of code here, one's maximum base number is 36 and output string while another's maximum base number is 10 and output float, 
use depends on your purpose.
# For debugging and improving, logging is enabled and will send to sqlite3's database.
More informations is on the codes' comments
